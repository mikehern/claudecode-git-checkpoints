# Contributing to claudecode-git-checkpoints

Thanks for your interest in improving the project! This guide focuses on reporting bugs and requesting features
so we can triage quickly and ship fixes faster.

## How to report a bug

1. Update to the latest release and try to reproduce.
2. Collect diagnostics:
   - `claudecode-git-checkpoints --version`
   - OS/shell/arch and `git --version`
   - Re-run with `--debug` and capture relevant logs (redact secrets).
3. Open a bug using the issue form:
   - Open: https://github.com/mikehern/claudecode-git-checkpoints/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml
   - Include a minimal reproduction (tiny repo or script) if possible.
4. Expectation: we triage within 2 business days and aim to reproduce within 5.

Tip: A minimal repro (10‚Äì30 lines) massively speeds up fixes. If you can‚Äôt share a repo, describe exact
commands and outputs.
